    "# EN.705.625 — Introduction to Agentic AI  \n",
    "## Module 11 — Generative Agent Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Primer:**  \n",
    "> In this module, we explore how generative AI (GenAI) *unlocks agency*, moving beyond static models to systems that plan, decide, use tools, remember, and self-correct. We will work hands-on in Jupyter notebooks using local models (via **Ollama**) to build the minimal components of an agent: prompting patterns, structured outputs, tool-calling, lightweight memory, and reflection loops, then weave them into a coherent generative agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Generative AI for Agency: Historical Context & Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern agentic systems stand on three converging threads:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Generative Modeling Matures**  \n",
    "   - Early sequence models (n-grams, RNNs/LSTMs) could generate text but lacked robustness.  \n",
    "   - **Transformers (2017→)** enabled scalable context + transfer, yielding models that can *reason in natural language*, follow instructions, and generalize.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Instruction-Following & Emergent Tool Use**  \n",
    "   - Instruction tuning & alignment improved *controllability*: “Do X, in Y format, under Z constraints.”  \n",
    "   - Models now reliably emit *structured outputs* (JSON/YAML), making it practical to **parse intent → call tools → integrate results**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Programmatic Scaffolding (Agency Loops)**  \n",
    "   - Patterns like **CoT (chain-of-thought)**, **ReAct (reason–act–observe)**, and **self-critique/reflection** turn a single model into a *controller* that plans, executes, and revises across steps.  \n",
    "   - With even a small set of tools (search, calculator, file I/O, domain APIs) and **lightweight memory**, GenAI becomes the *glue* that coordinates actions in open-ended tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Motivation:**  \n",
    "Generative models provide a *universal interface*, natural language, for planning, decomposing tasks, and orchestrating tools. This makes agents more adaptable (new domains with less bespoke code), more explainable (textual reasoning traces), and more *extensible* (add tools / memories without retraining). In short, GenAI upgrades agents from scripted automatons to **adaptive operators** in complex environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this module, students will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Explain** how generative models enable agent capabilities (planning, tool-use, memory, reflection) compared to non-generative systems.  \n",
    "2. **Differentiate** prompting patterns (Instruction → Input → Output, CoT, ReAct, self-critique) and **select** appropriate patterns for a given task.  \n",
    "3. **Operate** local GenAI via **Ollama** to produce both free-form and **schema-constrained** (JSON) outputs reliably.  \n",
    "4. **Implement** a minimal tool-calling loop that routes model-specified actions to Python functions and integrates observations back into the reasoning loop.  \n",
    "5. **Design** lightweight **episodic memory** and a basic **planning/dispatcher** to execute multi-step tasks with model guidance.  \n",
    "6. **Instrument & Judge** agent runs using latency/robustness metrics and an LLM-as-judge rubric to assess correctness, completeness, and safety.  \n",
    "7. **Argue** when to prefer deterministic code (regex/parsers/math) or retrieval/RAG over raw prompting—tradeoffs in reliability, cost, and speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We’ll Build\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **Task Assistant Agent** that:  \n",
    "  1) decomposes a goal into steps,  \n",
    "  2) calls tools (e.g., calculator, lookup stubs),  \n",
    "  3) records short-term notes,  \n",
    "  4) self-critiques the draft, and  \n",
    "  5) returns a structured final report—**all locally** with Ollama.\n",

    "> **Roadmap (Notebooks):**  \n",
    "> 01) Generative AI Primer → 02) Ollama Basics → 03) Prompting for Agents → 04) Tool Use → 05) Memory → 06) Planning & Reflection → 07) Instrumentation → 08) Safety & Determinism → 09) Patterns vs Alternatives → 10) Mini-Project Agent\n"

    "# Section 01 — Generative AI Primer (with LLM Parameters)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Generative AI Supercharges Agency\n",
    "Generative models turn language into a **control layer**: they can decompose goals, reason step-by-step, call tools via structured outputs (e.g., JSON), and refine drafts through self-critique. This unlocks agent behaviors—**planning, tool-use, memory, reflection**—that go far beyond reactive rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Historical arc (very brief):** RNNs/LSTMs → Transformers (2017) → instruction tuning & alignment → tool-use and structured generation → reliable local inference (e.g., **Ollama**). The net effect is **controllability**: we can steer models to act as *operators* in open-ended tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parameters that Shape LLM Behavior (Ollama-style)\n",
    "> Availability/semantics can vary by model/runtime. The most common controls below map cleanly to local LLaMA-family models run via Ollama.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`temperature`**: Scales randomness during sampling.  \n",
    "  - Lower (≈0.0–0.3): deterministic, focused, repeatable.  \n",
    "  - Higher (≈0.7–1.0+): creative, exploratory—useful for brainstorming or plan diversification.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`top_p` (nucleus sampling)**: Samples only from the smallest probability mass ≥ *p*.  \n",
    "  - Lower (e.g., 0.8–0.9) trims tail tokens → safer, more stable.  \n",
    "  - Works well *with* or *instead of* `temperature`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`top_k`**: Restricts sampling to the *k* most probable tokens at each step.  \n",
    "  - Lower values reduce off-topic drift; higher values allow more variety.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`num_predict` (max tokens)**: Cap on generated tokens.  \n",
    "  - Prevents runaways; useful to enforce concise answers or JSON payloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`stop`**: One or more stop strings; generation halts when seen.  \n",
    "  - Great for delimiting sections or enforcing JSON closure (paired with validation).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`seed`**: Sets PRNG seed for reproducibility.  \n",
    "  - Combine with `temperature=0` for near-deterministic results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Repetition & Diversity controls** (model/runtime dependent):\n",
    "  - **`repeat_penalty`** / **`repeat_last_n`**: Penalize recent tokens to reduce loops.  \n",
    "  - **`presence_penalty`**: Encourages introducing *new* tokens/themes.  \n",
    "  - **`frequency_penalty`**: Discourages *overused* tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Context/efficiency** (runtime dependent):\n",
    "  - **`num_ctx`**: Context window size (max tokens the model can attend).  \n",
    "  - **`mirostat` / `mirostat_tau` / `mirostat_eta`**: Alternative adaptive sampling for stable perplexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Heuristic defaults (safe starting point):**  \n",
    "`temperature=0.2–0.7`, `top_p=0.9`, `top_k=40`, `num_predict` sized to your task, add `stop` guards for structure, and enable a mild `repeat_penalty`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quick Experiments\n",

      "An AI agent can employ three key strategies to make decisions under uncertainty:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Decision Trees**: This strategy involves structuring possible decisions and their potential outcomes in a tree format. Each node represents a decision or an action, and each branch represents the possible consequences of that decision. Decision trees help visualize different paths and outcomes, allowing the AI to choose the optimal course of action based on probable results.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Reinforcement Learning**: Here, the AI learns by interacting with its environment through trial and error. The agent takes actions and receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties, gradually learning which actions yield the best results over time. This approach enables the AI to adapt and improve its decision-making as it gains more experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Probabilistic Models**: These models incorporate probability theory to account for uncertainty. They analyze various factors contributing to uncertain outcomes, assigning probabilities to each possible outcome. The AI uses these models to make decisions based on the likelihood of different results, optimizing choices by considering statistical predictions.\n",

      "Each strategy addresses different facets of uncertainty: decision trees through structured outcomes, reinforcement learning via adaptive behavior, and probabilistic models with statistical analysis. Together, they provide a comprehensive toolkit for an AI agent to navigate uncertain environments effectively.\n",

      "An AI agent can employ three primary strategies to make decisions under uncertainty: decision trees, reinforcement learning, and probabilistic models. Each strategy has its own strengths and limitations, and their effective use depends on the specific context and requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Decision Trees**: This approach involves creating a tree structure where each node represents a decision or an uncertain event, with branches showing possible outcomes. The AI evaluates these outcomes based on their probabilities to choose the optimal path. While systematic, decision trees can become complex with many variables, potentially leading to overfitting.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Reinforcement Learning**: This dynamic strategy involves an agent interacting with an environment, taking actions, and receiving rewards or penalties. Over time, the agent learns the best strategies by maximizing cumulative rewards. It adapts well to unpredictable environments but may require extensive trials, making it less suitable for real-time applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Probabilistic Models**: Using probability theory, these models represent uncertainty in data or predictions. Bayesian networks, for example, use nodes and dependencies to predict outcomes. They are effective for structured problems with quantifiable factors but can become complex with numerous variables or sparse data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Integration of these strategies allows for a balanced approach: decision trees for structured decisions, reinforcement learning for adaptive refinement, and probabilistic models for risk assessment. Balancing exploration and exploitation is crucial, though this requires careful management to avoid overfitting or inefficiency. Each strategy's limitations must be considered, such as complexity in decision trees, the need for data in probabilistic models, and the time requirements of reinforcement learning.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, an AI agent would likely use a combination of these strategies tailored to the problem at hand, considering factors like environmental complexity, data availability, and decision speed. This approach ensures robustness and adaptability in various scenarios.\n",
      "\n",
      "=== temperature=0.7 ===\n",
      "An AI agent navigating decision-making under uncertainty can employ the following three strategies:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Utility-Based Decision Making**: This strategy involves assigning a numerical value, known as utility, to each possible outcome. The agent calculates the expected utility of each action by summing the product of each outcome's probability and its utility. The action with the highest expected utility is chosen, aiming for the best average outcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Heuristic-Based Strategies**: Utilizing simple rules or shortcuts to make decisions quickly without exhaustively evaluating all possibilities. While efficient, heuristics can lead to errors due to oversights in considering all variables, akin to cognitive biases such as availability bias.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Proactive Risk Management with Probabilistic Models**: This approach involves using techniques like decision trees or influence diagrams to map out potential future scenarios and select actions based on predicted outcomes. It emphasizes anticipating uncertainty through probabilistic reasoning to guide decisions actively rather than passively.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each strategy addresses uncertainty in distinct ways: the first quantitatively, the second qualitatively with shortcuts, and the third with predictive models.\n",
      "\n",
      "=== temperature=1.0 ===\n",
      "An AI agent can employ three key strategies to navigate decision-making under uncertainty effectively:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Probability and Statistics**: The agent leverages statistical models and probabilistic reasoning to predict outcomes based on historical data. This approach helps in making informed decisions by considering the likelihood of various outcomes, reducing uncertainty through data-driven insights.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Feedback Loops**: By continuously monitoring and adapting its decisions based on observed outcomes, the agent learns from experience. This dynamic adjustment enhances decision-making accuracy over time as it refines strategies based on real-world results.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Scenario Planning**: The agent prepares for multiple potential future scenarios, allowing it to adapt proactively to different conditions. This strategy is particularly valuable in complex environments with many variables, where thorough preparation against various possibilities improves resilience and effectiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "These strategies work synergistically, enabling the AI to make robust decisions even in highly uncertain and dynamic environments.\n"

      "1. **Adaptability:** RL enables vehicles to handle unpredictable situations by continuously interacting with their environment, allowing real-time adaptation without explicit programming.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Dynamic Environment Handling:** RL excels in dynamic settings where rules are unclear, as it learns from each experience and can perform well under varying conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Optimized Decision-Making:** The ability to learn optimal actions for split-second decisions enhances safety and efficiency by continuously improving based on past experiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Cons of Using Reinforcement Learning (RL) for Autonomous Vehicles:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Extensive Training Data Requirements:** RL necessitates a vast amount of diverse driving data, which is time-consuming and costly to collect.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Implementation Complexity:** The complexity of RL algorithms requires significant expertise and computational resources, adding to the challenge of implementation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Sample Bias:** Limited or non-diverse training data can lead to poor generalization, especially in challenging conditions not represented in the dataset.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Explainability and Safety Concerns:** Lack of transparency in decision-making processes raises safety concerns and complicates regulatory oversight.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Computational Demands:** Training RL models for autonomous vehicles requires substantial computational resources, which can be a barrier to implementation.\n",

Create the desired environment by importing Gym and using `gym.make(environment_name)`, such as `env = gym.make('CartPole-v1')`. Wrap this environment with Gym's Monitor to track performance metrics. Choose a policy class from Stable Baselines3, like PPO or A2C, and initialize it with your environment. Use the train function provided by Stable Baselines3, passing in your environment and policy along with training parameters such as iterations and steps per episode. After training completes, close the environment using `env.close()` to free resources and save the trained model for future use. This setup efficiently integrates Gym's environments with Stable Baselines3's algorithms for effective reinforcement learning development.\n",

      "➡️ Step 2: Define a specific RL problem, such as a grid world, to solve.\n",
      "Result:\n",
      " The reinforcement learning (RL) problem involves an agent navigating a grid world to reach a goal from a start point while avoiding obstacles. The environment is structured with walls in certain areas, and the agent can move up, down, left, or right. Each state includes the agent's position and whether it holds a key, providing context for actions. Rewards are positive upon reaching the goal, negative for hitting walls, and zero otherwise. A policy guides decision-making based on current states, using strategies like epsilon-greedy to balance exploration and exploitation. Value functions estimate expected rewards, aiding in learning optimal states. Q-learning directly estimates action utilities without a model. The agent interacts with the environment, receiving feedback through actions and rewards. Over time, employing algorithms like SARSA or Q-learning, the agent refines its policy, eventually mastering efficient navigation to the goal. This structured approach enables the agent to learn effective paths through iterative experience in the grid world.\n",
      "\n",
      "➡️ Step 3: Implement an agent using algorithms like Deep Q-Network (DQN).\n",
      "Result:\n",
      " To implement an agent using Deep Q-Network (DQN), first define the problem and create a suitable state representation that captures the environment's relevant information. Next, design the action space by identifying all possible actions the agent can take. Then, build a deep neural network to approximate the Q-values for each state-action pair. Implement experience replay to store past interactions and sample from them during training to improve learning stability. Use an epsilon-greedy policy to balance exploration (random actions) and exploitation (greedy actions based on current knowledge). Train the agent by iterating through episodes, where it interacts with the environment, observes rewards, updates its Q-values using a loss function, and gradually reduces exploration as it learns optimal behaviors. This process allows the agent to learn effective strategies for solving complex tasks efficiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "➡️ Step 4: Train the model with appropriate hyperparameters for optimal performance.\n",
      "Result:\n",
      " To train a machine learning model effectively, first select the appropriate algorithm based on the problem type (e.g., classification or regression). Next, employ hyperparameter tuning using methods like grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization to find optimal settings. Utilize cross-validation for reliable performance evaluation and consider data preprocessing steps such as feature scaling or normalization. Prevent overfitting through techniques like regularization or dropout. Test the final model on a separate test set after evaluating its generalization potential. Additionally, explore ensemble methods if needed to enhance performance. By systematically addressing each aspect from algorithm selection to post-training evaluation, you can achieve an optimally trained model.\n",

Collect detailed metrics such as success rates, time taken, and resource usage for each run. Perform statistical analysis by calculating the average performance and standard deviation to understand typical outcomes and variability. Analyze trends in the data to identify consistent strengths or weaknesses and determine if any specific seed consistently enhances performance. Compare these results against set objectives and use visualizations to aid interpretation, ensuring a comprehensive assessment of the agent's reliability and robustness.\n",

      " To debug and fix issues during training or testing, first verify data quality by checking for missing values and biases in your dataset using summary statistics. Ensure the model learns effectively by monitoring loss and accuracy metrics; if they stagnate, consider adjusting hyperparameters like learning rate or adding regularization techniques such as dropout to prevent overfitting. Check hardware resources to ensure sufficient GPU memory and CPU power are available. Assess for overfitting by evaluating performance on unseen data and increasing dataset diversity. Finally, if issues persist, consult forums or colleagues for additional insights and potential solutions.\n",

      "Okay, so I need to figure out how to make a large language model (LLM)-powered agent more resistant to prompt injection attacks. Hmm, what exactly is prompt injection? From what I remember, it's when someone tries to trick the AI by including malicious prompts in the query. The AI then uses that information to give incorrect or harmful answers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alright, so first step: understanding the problem. The user wants three practical steps. Let me think about how an LLM can be made more robust against such attacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe one approach is to detect and filter out suspicious prompts before they reach the model. But how? Maybe by monitoring the input for keywords or patterns that indicate malicious intent. I've heard of something called prompt validation, where you check if the user's query is legitimate. So step one could be implementing prompt validation mechanisms. That makes sense because it would catch attempts to inject malicious prompts early on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another idea is to limit the number of times a user can ask questions with suspicious prompts. If someone tries too many variations of a bad prompt, maybe the system can block them after a few failed attempts. So step two could be implementing rate limiting or detection systems that cap the number of prompt injection attempts from an IP address.\n",
      "\n",
      "What else? Maybe making the model more robust by improving its own ability to detect and handle ambiguous or conflicting prompts. If the LLM is better at identifying when it's being fed bad information, it can respond more defensively. So step three could involve enhancing the model's internal mechanisms for detecting and mitigating prompt injection attacks.\n",

      "Wait, but how \n",
      "\n",
      "=== Variant B (structured) ===\n",
      " <think>\n",
      "Okay, so the user wants me to list three practical steps to harden an LLM-powered agent against prompt injection. They specified that each step should be a numbered bullet with no extra text and each under 14 words.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to understand what prompt injection is. It's when attackers trick the model into executing arbitrary code by manipulating the prompts. So, the goal is to make the system robust against such attacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step one: Token-level validation. This means checking each token in the input before processing. If any token isn't recognized, it could be an indicator of malicious intent. But I need to keep it concise, so maybe \"Validate each token for validity\" as the first step.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, context-aware detection. By analyzing patterns in the user's queries, we can spot anomalies that might indicate injection attempts. So, something like \"Analyze query patterns for anomalies\" could work as the second point.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, monitoring and logging. Continuously watching for suspicious activities and recording them helps in quickly identifying and mitigating threats. Thus, \"Monitor logs for suspicious activity\" makes sense as the third step.\n",

      "3. **Encrypt Data:** Enable encryption on your devices, especially for sensitive files, messages, and cloud storage to protect against unauthorized access.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Update Software Regularly:** Keep your operating system, browsers, and applications updated to patch vulnerabilities before they become exploited by attackers.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Use Firewalls or Antivirus Software:** Install and configure firewalls or antivirus programs to block malicious traffic and detect malware attempts.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Secure Your Wi-Fi Network:** Use strong passwords for your Wi-Fi network and disable the automatic setup (WPS) feature to prevent unauthorized access from public networks.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Enable VPNs:** If you rely on public Wi-Fi, enable a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to secure your internet connection and protect your browsing activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Be Cautious of Phishing Attempts:** Stay vigilant when receiving emails or messages asking for personal information. Always verify the source before responding.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Backup Your Data:** Implement both cloud-based and physical backups to ensure that you can recover lost data in case of accidental deletions or disasters.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Limit Login Attempts:** Use two or three-factor authentication to limit unauthorized login attempts, reducing the risk of brute force attacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. **Monitor Network Activity:** Set up alerts in your cybersecurity software to detect unusual network activity that could indicate a security breach.\n",
